# PROJECT: Analysis of Municipal Employee Satisfaction in the State of Washington: Trend Identification and Improvement Recommendations
## Description: 
This is an analysis of survey responses from **1,500 municipal employees in Washington State** conducted by **Pierce County WA**. This dataset consists of 14725 records (responses) and 9 columns. It was downloaded from the website: **Maven Analytics Data Playground** whose link is: (https://mavenanalytics.io/data-playground?page=3&pageSize=5). This project aims to answer the following main questions:

1- Which survey questions did respondents agree with or disagree with most?

2- Do you see any patterns or trends by department or role?

3- As an employer, what steps might you take to improve employee satisfaction based on the survey results?

## KEY INDICATORS

The analyses reveal interesting trends in employee perceptions, highlighting significant differences between departments and hierarchical levels.

Firstly, the 'Planning and Public Works' department stands out with the highest level of disagreement, suggesting specific concerns within this department that could affect employee morale and satisfaction. In contrast, the 'Clerk of Superior Court', 'Family Justice Center', and 'Economic Development' departments show very low levels of disagreement, indicating higher cohesion or satisfaction among employees.

A deeper analysis reveals that employees in the 'Associates' and 'Supervisors' departments tend to be most in agreement with the questions, while 'Associates' and 'Staff' are those expressing the most disagreement. This raises potential concerns regarding communication, interpersonal relationships, and job satisfaction, highlighting areas where improvements could be made to foster a more positive and productive work environment.

In conclusion, these analyses provide valuable insights to identify areas for improvement and implement targeted measures to enhance employee engagement and promote a healthy and collaborative organizational culture.
